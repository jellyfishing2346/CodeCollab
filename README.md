üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Node.js (LTS version recommended)

    npm or Yarn

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/codecollab.git
    cd codecollab

    Install frontend dependencies:

    cd frontend # Assuming your Next.js app is in a 'frontend' directory
    npm install # or yarn install

    Install backend dependencies:

    cd ../backend # Assuming your Node.js/WebSocket server is in a 'backend' directory
    npm install # or yarn install

Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file in your frontend directory and a .env file in your backend directory.

Frontend (frontend/.env.local):

NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:YOUR_WEBSOCKET_PORT

Backend (backend/.env):

PORT=YOUR_BACKEND_PORT
WEBSOCKET_PORT=YOUR_WEBSOCKET_PORT

Replace YOUR_BACKOCKET_PORT and YOUR_WEBSOCKET_PORT with your desired port numbers (e.g., 3001 for backend, 8080 for websockets).
Running the Application

    Start the backend server:

    cd backend
    npm start # or node server.js (or your main server file)

    Start the frontend development server:

    cd frontend
    npm run dev

    Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port Next.js starts on).

üí° Usage

    Create/Join a Session: Upon opening the application, you can create a new collaborative session or join an existing one using a unique session ID.

    Start Coding: Once in a session, you'll see the shared code editor. Any changes you make will be instantly visible to other participants.

    Video Chat: Click the video icon to enable your camera and microphone and start communicating with your team.

    Language Selection: (Future Feature/Implementation Detail) Choose your preferred programming language from a dropdown to enable appropriate syntax highlighting.

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

    User Authentication: Implement user login/registration.

    Session Management: Persistent sessions, ability to save and load code.

    Chat History: Text-based chat alongside video.

    File Explorer: Support for multiple files within a project.

    Terminal Integration: A shared terminal for running commands.

    Code Playback: Replay changes made during a session.

    Custom Themes: Allow users to customize the editor's appearance.

    Error Handling & Robustness: Improve stability and user feedback for network issues.
